The data used is queried from Steam Web API \cite{steamworks} using Python for the games used in the project. 
Data is stored in parquet file format \cite{apacheparquet} for efficient storing and good interaction with Pandas.
Code used for extracting and storing is available in the project repository \cite{repository}.

The data from the reviews API consists of a summary of the statistics for the game, information about the author and the review itself with meta data. 
The full specification is available on Steam review API page \cite{steamworks}.

Processing of the data consisted of converting between different data types and creating a consistent dataset from the API. 
Data types were converted to the most suited for use with the Python packages, such as Scikit-learn, Numpy and Pandas.
Mostly this involved datetime convertions.

The data was also stripped of personal information about the author, recommendationid and author, which could easily be used to trace the user accounts.
Due to the Term of Use for Steam Web API \cite{steamapi} data is not provided with the project.

The datasets used consisted of 137982 reviews for training and testing from GTA V and 24333 reviews from Wolcen for validation.
