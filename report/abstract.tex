Every report must include an abstract. This abstract must be one paragraph,
and may not exceed 200 words. The abstract should provide a concise summary of
your project’s purpose, method, and results. Note that the abstracts of all projects will
be published on the course website.

Your report should contain between 2,000 and 4,000 words, corresponding
to approximately 4–8 pages of single-spaced text. This guidance excludes the title
and abstract, as well as any non-textual elements such as figures, tables, mathematical
formulas. Even references are excluded from this guidance.
